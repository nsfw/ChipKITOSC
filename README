chipKITOSC - ArdOSC for chipKIT32 and DNETcK
Based on:  ArdOSC 2.1  - OSC Library for Arduino.

=== History ===
30JAN12 - working version with chipKITEthernet (flakey)
07FEB12 - switched to DNETcK for stability in high bandwidth

=== Overview ===
This library most definately NEEDS HEAP allocated to it to run, by
default their is little or no heap allocated. You can allocate heap by
finding the "pic32.compiler.c.elf.flags" entry in the "platforms.txt"
and changing it to look like the following:

pic32.compiler.c.elf.flags=-Os::-Wl,--gc-sections,--defsym,_min_heap_size=8192::-mdebugger

This library has been reduced to the OSC specific elements support the encoding and decoding
OSC messages. The communication of components have been extracted (for now?) and should happen
in your sketch for now.

=== Installation ===
Is the same as for Arduino Libraries, just copy the chipKITOSC folder into ..
