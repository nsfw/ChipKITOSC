chipKITOSC - ArdOSC for chipKIT32 and DNETcK
Based on:  ArdOSC 2.1  - OSC Library for Arduino.

=== History ===
30JAN12 - working version with chipKITEthernet (flakey)
07FEB12 - switched to DNETcK for stability in high bandwidth

=== Overview ===

The current version of this library REMOVES the network details an
focuses just the message formatting / encoding / decoding details.

In this way it's platform independent... aka bring your own UDP layer.

HEAP:
This library most definately NEEDS HEAP allocated to it to run, by
default their is little or no heap allocated. You can allocate heap by
finding the "pic32.compiler.c.elf.flags" entry in the "platforms.txt"
and changing it to look like the following:

pic32.compiler.c.elf.flags=-Os::-Wl,--gc-sections,--defsym,_min_heap_size=8192::-mdebugger

=== Installation ===
